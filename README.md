# Automatic-Faucet-System
The Automatic Faucet System, powered by the ARM Cortex M3-based LPC1768 microcontroller, leverages the Keil RTX kernel RTOS to achieve efficient water dispensing automation. The system integrates an IR sensor module, a 16x2 LCD display in 4-bit mode, and an SG90 servo motor for precise and responsive operation.
